        <h1 id="tags">HTML tags</h1>
        <p>HTML indicates structure, and only incidentally appearance.  Much
            seriously noxious HTML comes from trying to get the HTML to do appearance,
            when CSS is really a far better tool for that.</p>
        <h2>Structural elements</h2>
        <p>Structural elements are part of the structure of the document,
            without necessarily having a whole lot to do with its appearance.
            So &lt;div&gt; marks off a division within the document, but says
            nothing whatever about what <em>kind</em> of division.  Similarly,
            &lt;span&gt; marks off a <span style="font-family: monospace">span of characters</span>, but tells nothing
            about why those particular characters are special.  The most common
            use for both &lt;div&gt; and &lt;span&gt; is to hang attributes on
            (often <span style="font-style: italic">style</span> or class 
            attributes, which we'll see in more detail later).
        </p>
        <h3>Headers</h3>
        <p>Header tags are also structural, but do tell something about what's
            special&mdash;that text is a header of the given level.</p>
        <h2>Links</h2>
        <p>Links, made with the &lt;a&gt; tag, make the World Wide Web actually
            webby, because pages link to <a href="https://converse.instructure.com/courses/5566/pages/software-installation">other pages</a>.
            The <var>href</var> attribute tells where the link goes.</p>
        <p>A link can point within a page to <a href="#tags">any tag that has an <var>id</var> attribute.</a></p>
        <h2>Text tags</h2>
        <h3>Relatively common</h3>
        <p>&lt;p&gt; tags enclose paragraphs.  &lt;em&gt; is emphasized text, usually
            rendered in italics <em>(but this is not guaranteed!)</em>.  &lt;strong&gt;
            encloses strongly emphasized text, usually rendered in bold (<strong>again,
                this is not guaranteed!</strong>).
        </p>
        <h3>Less common</h3>
        <p><sub>&lt;sub&gt;</sub> and <sup>&lt;sup&gt;</sup> do what they say.  &lt;br /&gt; forces<br>a line break.</p>
        <pre>HTML generally collapses white space in the code; use &lt;pre&gt; if you
            must
            have    control.
        </pre> 
        <blockquote>&lt;blockquote&gt; is good for long quotations, unlike this one.</blockquote>
        <h3>Geeks only</h3>
        <p>&lt;code&gt; encloses computer code.  &lt;var&gt; encloses variables, so:<br>
            <code><var>i</var> = <var>i</var> + 1</code>
        </p>
